# UK business analysis

Including bits for analysing the FAME dataset (not open, via university license), Companies House data (open! Lots of info!), ONS data.

## Useful things

Useful bits and bobs here:

* Get companies house entire UK data file and geocode in  [companieshouse.R](https://github.com/DanOlner/FirmAnalysis/blob/master/companieshousedata.R). Currently filters down to South Yorkshire, but uses the latest Codepoint open (via [this script](https://github.com/DanOlner/utilities/blob/master/postcodes_to_localauthorities_makelookup.R) in the utilities repo) and so can be used to filter to anywhere.
