#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#DISTANCE MATRIX COMPARISON FOR ALL SECTOR PAIRS----
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Continuing with approach above, let’s run for all pairs (testing for different SIC levels):
# • distance matrix between pairs of sectors
# • permuted distance matrices (1000 does a good job) from randomly selected firms of same number as the current pair
# • Z scores of the permute mean spread vs mean of sector pair distances
# 
# There’s also then a chance to pull out the density max peak from the pairs – I should keep and store that to look for patterns.





#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#TESTING LOCAL SAMPLING OF SECTOR PAIRS AND COMPARING TO SAME PAIR RANDOM DISTRIBUTION----
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#Testing this approach:
# 1. Pick n neighbouring firms from a pool of two sectors.
# 2. For the null, pick the same number of firms randomly from across the region of interest.
#This "assumes that, if there were no spatial clustering or co-location patterns, the local pool would reflect the overall regional sectoral mix" - 
#get the probability of sector x from that and then repeat multiple times to get a spread of probabilities. That can be used as the distribution for step 
# 3. Compare where the probability of firms from step 1 fits on the null distribution from step 2, effectively a p value.

#Again, test with two sectors
sector_x <- fame.geo %>% filter(grepl('Manufacture of other general-purpose machinery',SIC_3DIGIT_NAME))
# sector_y <- fame.geo %>% filter(grepl('Manufacture of basic iron and steel',SIC_3DIGIT_NAME))
sector_y <- fame.geo %>% filter(grepl('information',SIC_3DIGIT_NAME))#a bunch of information related sectors, in fact...

#Can use this for easy K nearest neighbours
#Order should match row order in the dfs above, so we can extract firm info
dist_matrix <- st_distance(sector_x, sector_y)

#Start with 20 nearest neigbours
#Our null will be sampling from the same two sectors randomly
#20 at a time
#And keeping the proportion sector split
#The mean is just going to be the proportion count of both
#We're after the spread from doing this

#That are both doing exactly the two-category point pattern analysis I want to do
#With weights too so e.g. we can include employee number 
#Though I'd like to understand what role that's playing - want to be able to say "how much more likely cluster due to larger firms?
#Tho easy test there would be dividing into two firm sizes and comparing

#From the paper p.751:
#"The meaning of the co-location M functions is thus simple: they test whether the relative density of employees from one
#sector around establishments of another sector is on average greater or lesser than in the whole area."
#Which would work to detect clustering, up to a point (greater no of employees = higher clustering chance)

# "The value of Equation (2) shows whether the relative density of plants S2 located
# around those of sector S1 is greater (MS1 ,S2 ðrÞ > 1) or lesser (MS1 ,S2 ðrÞ < 1) than in the
# entire area A."

#But no, it comparing to whole area?
